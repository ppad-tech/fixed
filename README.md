# ppad-fixed

A pure (**pre-release**, under construction) implementation of large
fixed-width integers and supporting operations.

## Usage

A sample GHCi session:

```
  > -- import qualified
  > import Data.Word.Extended as W
  >
  > -- use 'to_word256' to convert variable-length integers to Word256
  > let u = W.to_word256 0xFFFFFFFFFF
  > :t u
  u :: W.Word256
  >
  > -- compare values
  > let v = W.to_word256 0xFFFFFF
  > u `W.lt` v
  False
  >
  > -- bitwise operations
  > u `W.or` v      -- == u
  1099511627775
  > u `W.and` v     -- == v
  16777215
  >
  > -- arithmetic operations
  > (u `add` v) `sub` (u `add` v)
  0
  > u `mul` u `mul` u `mul` u `mul` u `mul` u `mul` u

  >
  > u `div` v
  65536
  >
  > -- modular reduction
  > u `mod` v
  65535
```

## Performance

The aim is best-in-class performance for pure, highly-auditable Haskell
code. Most operations beat out their variable-length Integer variants,
*but*, we have yet to reach parity with the all-important division and
modulo operations.

Current benchmark figures on my mid-2020 MacBook Air look like (use
`cabal bench` to run the benchmark suite):

## Security

This library aims at the maximum security achievable in a
garbage-collected language under an optimizing compiler such as GHC, in
which strict constant-timeness can be challenging to achieve.

If you discover any vulnerabilities, please disclose them via
security@ppad.tech.

## Development

You'll require [Nix][nixos] with [flake][flake] support enabled. Enter a
development shell with:

```
$ nix develop
```

Then do e.g.:

```
$ cabal repl ppad-fixed
```

to get a REPL for the main library.

## Attribution

This library is more or less a Haskell translation of the golang
[uint256](https://github.com/holiman/uint256) library.
